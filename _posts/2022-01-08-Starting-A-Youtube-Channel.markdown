## The _Goal_ of Content :rocket:
Dovetailing off of the last post `The New Direction`, this year I want to create 
`content`. 

1. I am going to do things I want to do
2. Share that with the world - the things I want
3. Hopefully, survey and welcome interest from the world in the things I want

## The _Medium_ of Content :lips:

The best forum I think I could use for doing this is via streaming or recording.

### Alternatives

> Previously, in the legacy iteration of this blog `The Daily Distribution`, I
studied Applied Mathematics daily, drafted notes and published them alongside
blog posts about my progress and goals.

> > I even went as far as writing some integration code which automated
the synchronization and categorization of the PDF notes from Notability
(which is already automatically exported to Google Drive) to my github.io
website repo (thereby injecting into my blog and publishing it externally).

> This was an efficient workflow and took around ~5 minutes after every morning
or lunchtime study session.
> But ultimately, while I found it efficient, the math wasn't very consumable
and I was using the blog additionaly as a Planning (e.g Jira/Rally/Asana) and
Documentation (e.g Confluence) tool and found a blog to be inefficient and
ineffective backend to those purposes.

I spent a bunch of time thinking about what would be the best setup using tools
that are already available and even contemplated and prototyped some possible
alternatives:

#### Alternative 1: Notability, an IPad and Apple Pencil :writing_hand:

Continue to use an IPad + Apple Pencil and continue to create Notability PDFs

#### Alternative 2: Confluence, Jira and Notability :woman_juggling:

Create Confluence Projects per math subject and centralize progress across
all math projects using [Advanced Roadmaps](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/Introducing-Advanced-Roadmaps/ba-p/1378497)
in Jira. Embed Notability PDFs on the Confluence Pages.
Instead of an IOS and Adroid Teams in the image below, there would
instead be Linear Algebra and Category Theory, etc.![Advanced Roadmap Example](/assets/2022-01-08-Starting-A-Youtube-Channel/jira_advanced_roadmaps.png).

#### Alternative 3: Jupyter Notebooks :computer:

Alternatively I could move to doing all math in Jupyter Notebooks. There is
something very attractive about math being computable and even having the
sharing the source code with others! A major functional gap in this approach
was that there wasn't an easy way to draw. Sure you could write some code to
generate plots but that's too much of a time sink. Building libraries to make
sucessive notebooks easier also a time sink - I want to do math! Not code. Also
the idea of having to manage and maintain technology details like notebook
pip package versions etc and code just being way more verbose than math
notation was unnatractive. Proof languages like [Coq](https://coq.vercel.app/ext/mdnahas/nahas_tutorial.html) weren't very readable to 
the average person - so proof-by-compiliation didn't seem like a win either. ![Doing math in Jupyter Notebooks](/assets/2022-01-08-Starting-A-Youtube-Channel/jupyter_math.png)

### Preferred Medium :movie_camera:

However, I've come to realize that there are other alternatives that allow
me to do math an share it - that are almost as efficient and much more comprehensible
to the average person. These alternatives also look like a lot of fun.

I'm talking `streaming` and `recording/producing` videos :camera_flash:!

Streaming is appealing because it seems like there is a relatively smaller
research step prior to the stream, it's easy to interact and walk through ideas,
and vastly engaging. On this front, I'm very taken with the engineering related
stream [George Hotz's does](https://youtu.be/MeE4Y2862FY?t=12372).

I also like the idea of using streams as an exploratory or survey method 
[a la Lex Fridman](https://youtu.be/DxREm3s1scA?t=5536).

Publishing by this means seems to be pretty conventional writ-large for a variety
of purposes:

- [Appetite of Public to learn about STEM](https://youtu.be/J0p_thJJnoo?t=5482)
- Other quizically complicated topics like [Chess via Hikaru or Carlson](https://www.youtube.com/c/GMHikaru/videos).

In particular [3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/F3Qixy-r_rQ?t=152) is a great
example of the power of something more structured and prerecorded and produced.

I am also very fascinated with [Technically-strong Innovative Teams like Neuralink, Tesla, SpaceX, Comma AI](https://youtu.be/iOWFXqT5MZ4?t=3065)
as they have similar goals as mentioned previously in this blog piece: do cool
things, be innovative and share.

So here is my `streaming/recording` setup:

![Stream Recording Gear](/assets/2022-01-08-Starting-A-Youtube-Channel/stream_recording_gear.png)

The next step is for me to configure the recording software and start to formalize
what things and how I want to stream them.


A few gists of what I want to do:

- learn new maths via solving the problem sets in textbooks and stream that
- publish primers, useful short productions on useful math

I'm considering using Latex to document my work with github:

If you're curious what notes some of my old blog had - here is a portion of the
notes I had posted:
