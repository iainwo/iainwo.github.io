You can distill your life down to a single page. To summarize your past - a Curriculum Vitae, of one page is the norm. If you were to summarize your future how long does that document have to be? If you're past the midpoint in your life and a CV suffices for your past, does the same length suffice for your future - then?

It may be that CVs only apply to a class of the work force - that is somewhat commoditized. One imagines there is a lot of preselection and orchestration behind the scenes - before or if CVs are required, for high-value low-population occupations and positions. For Presidency or the cofounder of your business - do you really start by accepting resumes?

Perhaps CVs are just a reductionist exercise for those without a significant economic edge. Or maybe CEOs, Presidents and Founders are just exceptions to the rule. Certainly, their business plans aren't oodles of pages long. If they are do you want to even read it and how can anybody excute on that.

If I could achieve anything in the next 10 years:

1. Invent/be one of the generative creative (engineering and otherwise) forces behind a technology that improves the quality of life of the common person by an order of magnitude (i.e 10X).
2. A functionally equivalent mathematical education of the most common machinery in Pure Maths.
3. Fluency in Russian

It may not be a truism that either #2 or #3 is required to achieve #1. But it is true, that my personality favours orderliness. And a formal, atomic and proper pedagogical-bent approach is the only tolerable way. Perhaps more importantly, trying to solve communal problems when you're are uneducated is dangerous. Not having the proper technical or communicative skills seems similar to other activities which shouldn't be done with impairment.
