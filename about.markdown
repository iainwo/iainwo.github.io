__On the Moon__ is the successor of the _Daily Distribution_ blog. It is written by Iain Wong. These pages document the ideals, goals and a litany of the writer's thoughts and experience.

The blog name hints at the underlying motivation of this website.

- Certain themes in the author's life could be better
- The author can't stop thinking about how to optomize these things
- Some of the strategies are lofty or moon-shots
- Some of these themes are hard to optimize and there solutions aren't so short-term that they can be solved by taking actionn
- This blog acts as a long-term strategy that will act as the creative bedrock for the troublesome themes in the author's life and the blogging activity will serve as an exploratory aide to the author whilst also being a naturally recurrent task - that hopes to encourage recurrent action towards these moon-shots

This blog focuses onnn mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.
